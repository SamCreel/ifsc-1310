            <h2>Old Reliable</h2> <!--- this is H2 because it falls under h1 -->
            <p> Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. 
            Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. 
            Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo <q>enjoyed</q> his journey into space. 
            Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.

            <h2>The Mission</h2>  <!--- Still h2 because it is still a subsection of Gordo himself -->
            <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space had to accomplish three things.
                         <ol>
                          <li> Take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral </li>
                          <li> Travel over 1500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles</li>
                          <li> Return to earth landing 1302 Nautical miles South of Cape Canaveral </li>
                         </ol>
<blockquote>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."
<cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut.</cite></blockquote>
            
            <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>  <!--- h3 becasue it fall under the mission catagories. Getting more setailed explation of one pf the h2 -->
            <p>The <strong>Jupiter IRBM</strong> (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for <em>political reasons</em>. 
            It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility </p>
            
            <h4>Flight Date: December 13, 1958 <!--- h4 because it continue to drill down into supsections. -->
Launch Time: 03.53 EST</h4>
            
            <h3>The Journey</h3> <!--- back to h3 becasue it is overall about the mission, the h2 from above. -->
            <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. 
            The space suit was fitted with many things including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Temperature meters</li>
            <li>Microphones</li>
            <li>Super Secret Space stuff</li> 
            <li>Super Secret Monkey Stuff</li>
            </ul>

<h5>Other Animals Flight time in Space</h5> <!--- h5 because it is a subsection of the subsectiosn subsection. Way into the "weeds here -->
